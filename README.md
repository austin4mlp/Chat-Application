# Chat-Application
This is a chat application I created to demonstrate my skills with the MEAN stack. It was created as a school project, and I have migrated it to this repository for public viewing. Please note that this project uses graphics magic to manipulate images. Please view the wiki to get more information on the environment setup and view some screenshots of the project in action.
